# AI-ML-Hackathon-GIH

### Highlights of the Notebook:

* Rescaled the images using ```ImageDataGenerator``` in ``Tensorflow``.
* Stratified the dataset of 55k samples to around 10k samples by collecting 400 samples from each label.
* Trained 3 different models, i.e., ResNet, DenseNet and VGG16 on the dataset and evaluated the accuraices.
* Also, performed voting from the 3 models' predictions and generated a final output from those predictions and compared the accuracies.
